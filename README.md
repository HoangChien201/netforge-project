## Installation
### Requirements
- NodeJS 16+

- Android/IOS device or emulator
>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Setup Guide
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NetForge.git
   cd NetForge
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up Firebase**
   - Add ```google-serivces.json```(Android) and ```GoogleService-Info.plist```(IOS) to the project
   - Configure Firebase Authentication & Firestore
5. **Run the app**
    - ##### For Android
   
   ```bash
   # using npm
   npm run android
   
   # OR using Yarn
   yarn android
   ```
   
   - ##### For iOS
   
   ```bash
   # using npm
   npm run ios
   
   # OR using Yarn
   yarn ios
   ```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
